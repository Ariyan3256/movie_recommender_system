# movie_recommender_system
The aim of this project is to develop a movie recommendation system that suggests five similar movies based on a given movie's name. The system leverages a dataset of 5000 movies and an associated credits dataset, utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and the Word2Vec model for prediction.
